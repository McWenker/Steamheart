# SteamHeart

![logo](Assets/Textures/UI/LOGO.png ":)")

Hello and welcome to SteamHeart, an upcoming indie RPGenre bender designed and developed by yours truly.

## Concept

SteamHeart is aimed at recreating some of the classic Tactics RPGs of yore (Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, etc)
and, hopefully, bringing it into the modern era with procedurally generated maps, expansive class tree, and more.

# Known issues
	A few Abilities and Status Effects are not operating as fully intended
		These include: Stun, Weaken
	The numbers are too high!
		Some classes are OP, have fun with that
	Battle does not always end when it should
		I mean that in two ways, sometimes it won't trigger the ending
		Other times, it will crash for unknown reasons
	No visual indicators of damage
	Characters sometimes "unjump" tweening into the ground rather than up
	Sometimes battle isn't visible after creating a character

All other issues please send to entro@chaosindivide.com or contact me via other known means
